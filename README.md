3 Modes of interactiveness
1) click passive abilities like spurn on SK's
2) dire mode where if player or group is detected to be in a dire situation, help (click instant cast saves, fades, etc)
3) normal mode where all normal activity is attempted


Rules of engagement:

if invis, don't break it. 
if nav is active, only use instant spells
